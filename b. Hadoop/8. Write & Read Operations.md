## Write and Read Operation
In HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), write and read operations refer to how data is stored and accessed in a distributed environment.

### Write Operation

| Step                    | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. **File Split**        | File is split into fixed-size blocks (128MB or 256MB).        |
| 2. **NameNode Request**  | Client requests NameNode for block storage locations.         |
| 3. **Block Assignment**  | NameNode assigns DataNodes for block storage.                |
| 4. **Data Transfer**     | Client starts writing data to the first DataNode.             |
| 5. **Replication**       | Data is replicated to other DataNodes as per the replication factor. |
| 6. **Acknowledgment**    | Client receives acknowledgment once writing is complete.     |

### Read Operation

| Step                    | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. **File Request**      | Client requests to read a file.                               |
| 2. **NameNode Lookup**   | Client queries NameNode for block locations.                 |
| 3. **Block Retrieval**   | Client retrieves blocks directly from DataNodes.             |
| 4. **Data Transfer**     | Data is transferred from DataNodes to client.                |
| 5. **Fault Tolerance**   | If a block is unavailable, it's fetched from another replica. |
| 6. **Completion**        | Client receives the full data after reading all blocks.      |
