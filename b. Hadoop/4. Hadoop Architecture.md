| **Part**           | **Description**                                                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster**        | A collection of nodes (machines) working together to store and process data in HDFS.                  |
| **Rack**           | A physical or logical group of machines within a data center. Helps optimize data locality and fault tolerance. |
| **Core Switch**    | A network switch that connects all the racks in the data center, facilitating communication between nodes. |
| **NameNode**       | The master server in HDFS that manages the filesystem's metadata, such as filenames, directories, and block locations. |
| **DataNode**       | The worker nodes that store actual data blocks in HDFS. Each **DataNode** handles data read and write requests. |
| **Block**          | The basic unit of storage in HDFS, typically 128 MB in size. Data is divided into blocks and distributed across DataNodes. |
| **Replica**        | Copies of data blocks stored on different **DataNodes** for fault tolerance and high availability. |
| **Client**         | The user or application that accesses the HDFS for reading and writing data.                          |




### Main Points
- Replication factor by default = 3.
- Block size in HDFS by default = 128 MB.

### Can we increase or decrease block size ?
Yes we can increase or decrease, but default is 128MB
