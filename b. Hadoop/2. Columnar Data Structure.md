## What is Columnar Data Structure ?

In Hadoop, a columnar data structure stores data by columns instead of rows, optimizing it for analytical queries. This approach is ideal for read-heavy operations, where only specific columns are needed for analysis. Columnar storage allows for better compression and query performance since data in each column is often homogeneous, reducing storage needs and improving efficiency.

### Popular Columnar Formats:
- Parquet: Best for complex data types and widely supported in Hadoop tools like Hive, Spark, and Impala.
- ORC: Optimized for Hive and OLAP queries, providing high compression and performance.

### Advantages:
- Efficient querying for large datasets by reading only necessary columns.
- Better compression for storage efficiency.
- Scalability for big data workloads.

### Use Cases:
- Data warehousing and real-time analytics.
- Log and event data analysis.
- Columnar formats excel in read-heavy scenarios but are less suited for write-heavy operations.
