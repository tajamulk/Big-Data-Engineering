## Node Failures

- Data Node Failures
- Name Node Failures
- Secondary Name Node vs Standby Name Node

### 1. Data Node Failure
situations where one or more DataNodes become unavailable or crash leading to unavailability of data

- Temporary Data Node Failure
- Permanent Data Node Failure

| **Aspect**               | **Temporary DataNode Failure**                                    | **Permanent DataNode Failure**                                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Short-term unavailability of the DataNode.                      | Irrecoverable loss of the DataNode.                          |
| **Causes**               | Network issues, reboot, minor software/hardware glitches.       | Disk crash, hardware failure, or intentional decommissioning.|
| **Duration**             | Short-term, usually recoverable.                                | Long-term or indefinite.                                     |
| **Impact on Data**       | Minimal; data is intact and accessible via replicas.            | Blocks on the failed node must be replicated elsewhere.      |
| **NameNode Response**    | Marks DataNode as unavailable; replication may start if prolonged. | Removes DataNode from the cluster and initiates replication. |
| **Process**              | 1. DataNode stops sending heartbeats. <br> 2. NameNode waits for the timeout period. <br> 3. Replication starts if needed. <br> 4. DataNode reconnects and syncs. | 1. DataNode stops sending heartbeats. <br> 2. NameNode marks it as dead. <br> 3. Replication immediately starts for affected blocks. <br> 4. Cluster operates without the failed node. |
| **Recovery**             | Node rejoins cluster once the issue is resolved.                | Blocks are re-replicated to other nodes; node replacement required. |
| **Examples**             | Temporary network outage or system maintenance.                 | Disk failure or physical damage to the DataNode.             |
| **Prevention**           | Regular monitoring and quick resolution of transient issues.    | Maintain proper replication factor and replace failed nodes promptly. |

#### Key Takeaways:
- HDFS handles failures gracefully.
- Metadata is the backbone of HDFS.
- RF is strictly maintained.

### 2. Name Node Failure
NameNode is the most critical part of Hadoop Cluster, failure halts the entire Hadoop cluster, as it manages the file system metadata, requiring either manual recovery in non-HA setups or automatic failover with a Standby NameNode in HA setups.

### 3. Secondary Name Node vs Standby Name Node

| **Aspect**               | **Secondary NameNode**                                | **Standby NameNode**                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role**                 | Assists with metadata housekeeping but does not provide operational continuity. | Provides seamless failover and operational continuity. |
| **Purpose**              | Merges fsimage and edit logs periodically.            | Acts as a backup to take over in case of failure.    |
| **Failover Capability**  | Cannot take over during NameNode failure.             | Can take over as Active NameNode during failure.     |
| **Data Synchronization** | Periodic, not real-time.                              | Real-time synchronization with the Active NameNode.  |
| **Configuration**        | Simple, does not require shared storage.              | Complex, requires shared storage or Quorum setup.    |
| **Use Case**             | Metadata maintenance in non-HA setups.               | Ensures high availability in production environments. |
| **High Availability**    | Does not support high availability; downtime occurs during failure. | Enables high availability with minimal or no downtime. |
| **Introduced In**        | Hadoop 1                                              | Hadoop 2                                             |

#### Conclusion:
The Secondary NameNode cannot eliminate downtime during a NameNode failure, as it does not serve as a live backup. It only processes metadata snapshots (fsimage and edit logs) and requires manual intervention to restore operations, leading to inevitable downtime until a new NameNode is configured.

In contrast, the Standby NameNode in a High Availability (HA) setup maintains real-time synchronization with the Active NameNode and can seamlessly take over during a failure, ensuring zero or minimal downtime and uninterrupted cluster operations.
