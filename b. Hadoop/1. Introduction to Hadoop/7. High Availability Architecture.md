#### Components of HA

| **Component**             | **Role**                                                           | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Active NameNode**        | Main controller managing HDFS namespace and block information.     | Handles all client operations like file creation, deletion, and metadata management. |
| **Standby NameNode**       | Hot backup of the Active NameNode, ready to take over during failure. | Synchronizes its state with the Active NameNode using edit logs stored in JournalNodes. |
| **DataNodes (DN)**         | Store actual data blocks and handle data read/write operations.    | Send regular block reports to both Active and Standby NameNodes.               |
| **JournalNodes (JN)**      | Maintain a shared edit log that keeps both NameNodes synchronized. | Facilitate consistent updates to the Standby NameNode to ensure it has the latest changes in the HDFS namespace. |
| **Zookeeper (ZK)**         | Coordinates failover and prevents split-brain scenarios.           | Monitors NameNode states and triggers leader election during failover.         |
| **Failover Controller**    | Monitors the health of NameNodes and initiates failover.           | Works with Zookeeper to perform automatic failover when the Active NameNode is unresponsive. |
| **Heartbeat Mechanism**    | Periodic signals exchanged between components to check health.    | Ensures timely detection of failures in NameNodes or DataNodes.                |
| **Block Reports**          | Periodic reports from DataNodes to NameNodes about stored blocks. | Ensures both Active and Standby NameNodes have accurate information about the location of data blocks in the cluster. |
| **Clients**                | Users or applications interacting with the Hadoop cluster.        | Access HDFS files through the Active NameNode. Failover is transparent to clients, ensuring uninterrupted service. |
