## MapReduce
MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets in a distributed computing environment.

#### Advantages:
- Scalability
- Fault tolerance
- Parallelism
- Data locality

#### Drawbacks:
- Complex to write and debug
- Usage has declined; less than 5% of companies now use MapReduce due to modern alternatives like Spark.

### Terminology

- Locality:
Processing data on the same node where it is stored to minimize network overhead and improve efficiency.
- Parallelism:
Dividing tasks into smaller sub-tasks and executing them simultaneously across multiple nodes to speed up processing.
