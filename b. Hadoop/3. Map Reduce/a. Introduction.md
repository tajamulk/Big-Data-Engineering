## Map Reduce

MapReduce in Hadoop is used for distributed processing with parallelism and data locality, ensuring efficient computation by processing data where it is stored.

### Locality: 
Processing data on the same node where it is stored to reduce network overhead.

### Parallelism: 
Splitting tasks into smaller units and executing them simultaneously across multiple nodes for faster processing.
