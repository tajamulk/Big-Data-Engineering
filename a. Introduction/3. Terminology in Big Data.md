## Terminology

### 1. Scalability
Scalability in Big Data refers to its ability to handle increasing storage or processing demands.
#### a. Storage Scalability: 
The ability of a system to expand its storage capacity seamlessly as data volume grows, ensuring data can be stored without impacting performance.
example: Adding extra hard drives or nodes to store more files when your data exceeds the current capacity.

#### b. Processing Scalability: 
The ability of a system to handle increasing computational workloads efficiently, often by distributing tasks across multiple nodes or scaling resources.
example: Using more computers (nodes) to analyze a larger dataset in parallel, so the processing time remains the same.
