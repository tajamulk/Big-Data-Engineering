## Terminology

- Scalability
- Reliability and Fault Tolerance
- Cost Effectiveness
- Security and Data Privacy


### 1. Scalability
Scalability in Big Data refers to ability of a systemt to handle increasing storage or processing demands.
#### a. Storage Scalability: 
The ability of a system to expand its storage capacity seamlessly as data volume grows, ensuring data can be stored without impacting performance.
example: Adding extra hard drives or nodes to store more files when your data exceeds the current capacity.
#### b. Processing Scalability: 
ability of a system to handle increasing computational workloads efficiently, often by distributing tasks across multiple nodes or scaling resources.
example: Using more computers (nodes) to analyze a larger dataset in parallel, so the processing time remains the same.

### 2. Reliability and Fault Tolerance: 
system's ability to perform consistentlyand to continue operating correctly even when some components (nodes) fail.
example: In Hadoop, if a DataNode fails, the system retrieves data from another replica without interrupting the processing.

### 3. Cost Effectiveness: 
ability of a system to deliver the desired performance and capacity at the lowest possible cost
example: Hadoop is designed to run on standard, affordable machines, making it a cost-effective solution for processing and storing large amounts of data.

### 4. Security and Data Privacy:
ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access and breaches.
example: Apache Hadoop provides multiple security features like Authentication, Autherization, Data Confidentiality, Audit etc.
