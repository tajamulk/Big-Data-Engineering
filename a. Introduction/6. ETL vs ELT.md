#### ETL vs ELT 

| **Aspect**       | **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**                     | **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Processing**   | Data is transformed before loading.                    | Data is transformed after loading.                      |
| **Location**     | Traditional data warehouses with limited compute power.| Modern data lakes or cloud platforms with high compute power. |
| **Data Type**    | Structured data.                                       | Structured, semi-structured, unstructured data.         |
| **Speed**        | Slower, as transformations occur beforehand.           | Faster, as transformations happen after loading.        |
| **Use Case**     | Bank transactions (cleaned before storage).            | Social media analysis (raw data stored for future processing). |
