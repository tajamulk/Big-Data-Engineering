| **Aspect**        | **OLAP**                                          | **OLTP**                                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**       | Analytical queries, decision support.             | Transactional queries, day-to-day operations.     |
| **Data Type**     | Historical, aggregated data for analysis.         | Real-time transactional data (e.g., sales, orders). |
| **Query Complexity** | Complex, long-running queries.                   | Simple, short, real-time queries.                |
| **Data Volume**   | Large datasets, typically read-heavy.             | Smaller, real-time datasets, write-heavy.        |
| **Speed**         | Slower, optimized for read-heavy operations.      | Fast, optimized for write-heavy operations.      |
