### Big Data Resources

The Three Key Resources in Big Data:

- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
The computational brain of Big Data systems, responsible for performing tasks in parallel to efficiently handle large-scale data.

- Memory (RAM)
A temporary storage medium that enables fast data processing, stores intermediate results, and powers in-memory frameworks like Apache Spark for enhanced speed.

- Disk (Storage)
A persistent storage solution for large datasets, ensuring scalability and reliability with technologies like HDFS that support replication and fault tolerance.
